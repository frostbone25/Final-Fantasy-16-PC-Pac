# Final Fantasy 16 PC Pac
Archive tool for Final Fantasy 16 on PC. This is still experimental and a work in progress so do not expect it to work on everything...

# Usage
Double click the .exe, it will open up a command prompt window asking you to paste in the **folder path** containing the .pac files. After entering that it will then ask you to enter another **folder path** which is where it will extract the contents of the .pac file into.
