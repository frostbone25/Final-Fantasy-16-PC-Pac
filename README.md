# Final Fantasy 16 PC Pac
Archive tool for Final Fantasy 16 on PC. This is still experimental and a work in progress so do not expect it to work on everything...

# ARCHIVED
As of 8/20/2024 I am closing this in favor of a better unpacker application **[found here by Nenkai.](https://github.com/Nenkai/FF16Pack)** If you are looking to extract with FF16 .pac files I recomend Nenkai's.

# Usage
Double click the .exe, it will open up a command prompt window asking you to paste in the **folder path** containing the .pac files. After entering that it will then ask you to enter another **folder path** which is where it will extract the contents of the .pac file into.

# Credits
These guys helped and were amazingly fast and quick at figuring out the .pac formats.
